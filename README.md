# Project Problem statement

For the project, we will ask you to build an end-to-end ML project. For that, you will need:

- Select a dataset that you're interested in (see datasets.md)
- Train a model on that dataset tracking your experiments
- Create a model training pipeline
- Deploy the model in batch, web service or streaming
- Monitor the performance of your model
- Follow the best practices
